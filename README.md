### Date created
Oct 16th 2025, I created this project and README file.

### Project Title
Exploring Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project analyzes bike share system data from three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. Using data provided by Motivate, we will uncover usage patterns and compare system behavior across these cities.

### Files used
The original, messier datasets have been wrangled into a consistent format for this analysis by Udacity: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv

### Credits
It's important to give proper credit. Add links to any repo that inspired you or blogposts you consulted.
