# Exploring Bikeshare Data

### Date created
Oct 16th 2025, I created this project and README file.

### Description
This project analyzes bike share system data from three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. Using data provided by Motivate, we will uncover usage patterns and compare system behavior across these cities.

### Key questions analyzed
**1. Popular Times of Travel:**\
Most common month\
Most common day of the week\
Most common hour of the day\
**2. Popular Stations and Trip:**\
Most common start station\
Most common end station\
Most common trip (start to end station combination)\
**3. Trip Duration:**\
Total travel time\
Average travel time\
**4. User Information:**\
Counts of each user type (Subscriber/Customer)\
Counts of each gender (only for NYC and Chicago)\
Earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth (only for NYC and Chicago)\
**5. Subscriber Information:**\
Count of each gender\
Count of Birth Year Groups (<1980, 1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, >2010)\
Statistics about Trip Duration (average, max, min)

The original, messier datasets have been wrangled into a consistent format for this analysis by Udacity: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv
